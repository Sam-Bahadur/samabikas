        SAMABIKAS Nepal (literally meaning equity and development) is a right
        based organization established by gender and rights activists for
        assisting the marginalized and excluded sections of the society, who
        have been the victims of the cultural and socio-economic bias and
        widespread caste and gender discrimination, in bringing tangible changes
        in their lives. This is a non-partisan, non-discriminatory and
        non-religious organization advocating for the establishment of a just
        and equitable society.
