        Shital B.K. : A journey from Budakot Achham to London United Kingdom
      </div>
      <p className="md:text-lg text-sm text-justify">
        Shital is a 16-year-old Chairperson of Bajinath Girls Empowerment Group
        in Budakot, Achham. The group was formed by SAMABIKAS Nepal comprising
        25 girls to empower them and as a strategy for curbing child-marriage.
        Coming from a tiny village where early and child marriage is common,
        Shital is determined to break the cycle and make education a priority.
        She is in her 10th standard and is passionate about fighting for girlsâ€™
        rights, and acts as a voice for every girl searching for meaning. Last
        year, Shital attended 3-day Gender and Leadership training provided by
        SAMABIKAS Nepal. Among all the trainees, Shital was determined to bring
        a change in herself and her family. She describes her time at her home
        was tough because she had to convince each family member that she will
        not stay in a menstrual hut and follow the menstrual taboos. But now she
        believes that her commitment has set her apart and made her who she is
        today. She is truly an example of the saying; change starts from within.
        In this one and half year time Shital has transformed herself from a
        member of the group to a leader of the group and this year she is the
        local resource person, who now leads, monitors, and coordinates
        interactive sessions with girls aged 12 to 19. Because of her
        outstanding performance among all the 125 adolescent girls group, she
        was chosen as a girl leader by SAMABIKAS Nepal to visit an award
        ceremony conducted by With and For Girls in London on March 2020. Now,
        she is also in charge of taking weekly BLOP classes to her friends and
        earns income that she uses to buy her school supplies. She skillfully
        plans, speaks, creates an agenda, and leads the meetings. One of the
        major achievements is that recently, Shital and her group inspired other
        girls (who are not in the group formed by SAMABIKAS Nepal) to make a
        commitment by lighting oil lamps as a promise to stay against child
        marriage and break all menstrual taboos. She consistently seeks
        opportunities for leadership and is committed to being a young leader
        and works to empower girls and educate on their rights.
