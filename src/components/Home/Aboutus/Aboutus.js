          Nepal is a country with widespread social injustice particularly
          against the resource poor communities. There is deep-rooted cultural
          bias and social, caste and gender based discrimination. Moreover,
          women are the most vulnerable people, who have been the victims of the
          socio-cultural and economic set-up and the traditionally male
          dominated social construction.

          based organisation established by gender and rights activists for

          widespread caste and gender discrimination, in bringing tangible
          changes in their lives. This is a non-partisan, non-discriminatory and
          non-religious organization advocating for the establishment of a just
          and equitable society.
