        Achham is located in Sudur-Paschim Province of Nepal. According to UNDP,
        Achham comes in 69th position when it comes to development list. It is a
        rural area where the literacy rate between males and females has a huge
        gap. 71% of men aged five and above are literate in Achham, only 43% of
        such women in the district can read and write. 90% area of Achham is
        mid-hill and 10% is high-hill which is why it is one of the least
        developed district in Nepal. Accham is divided into total 10 local level
        bodies, in which four are urban and six are rural. Achham is one of the
        remotest districts of Nepal. The district is served by two hospitals,
        the government district hospital in Mangalsen and one recently opened in
        Bayalpata named Bayalpata Hospital. There is one doemstic airport
        located in Sanfebagar, Achham. People do not have proper access to
        health services. Child-marriage and early motherhood are prevalent in
        many rural areas because of less awareness. They do not have clear idea
        on the consequences of early marriage. Poverty remains predominantly a
        major problem in Achham and that has created very less access to social
        service. Another major condition that affect our work is the male
        dominated society. Women in Achham live under the same harsh conditions
        are their male counterparts but experience additional cultural and
        policy biases. They are unpaid family labors and that has restricted
        their movement. They are prevented from working outside home.
